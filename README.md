# JavaScript Connections Assignment

For this project, I took the mock profile page I created in the CSS section of our Web Fundamentals module and added some JavaScript functionality to it. In the "Connection Requests" box, clicking the check mark will remove the request box, reduce the requests number by one, and increase the "Your Connections" number by one. Clicking on the "x" button do everything that happens with clicking the check mark, except it will leave the "Your Connections" number the same.
